$desc = 'This project was part of my bachelor thesis (2012) at the design department at Hochschule Trier. A musical composition is created by arranging visual elements on the surface. Those elements can be moved, combined and divided. The shape and position is then mapped to different acoustic attributes. Hardware and software are both custom build. The table is based on a system with IR leds and the software was build with Processing and the reacTIVision framework. Audio was connect via PureData and OSC.
